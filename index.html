        <p style="font-size: 12px">With the list of endangered animals growing exponentially as habitats are destroyed,
            forests are cut down, and oceans are polluted, the <b>Hawksbill Turtle</b> remains <br> one of the most
            endangered animals on the planet.</p>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>The name of the <b>Hawksbill Sea Turtle</b>, or <i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>, derives from the features
            of the animal, as it exhibits a narrow, pointed beak.  They also have a distinctive and recognizable
            pattern of overlapping scales on their shells which form a serrated-look on the edges. These shells
            make the turtles highly-valuable, as markets sell these patterns and shells as "tortoise-shell".
            <b>Hawksbills</b> are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, predominantly in coral reefs.
            They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on a reef,
            but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish. Sea turtles belong to a group of reptiles that has existed on
            Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years.</p>

    <h2>Threats to the Species</h2>
        <p>There are many different threats to the species, including <b>illegal trading</b> and <b>pollution</b>.</p>
        <h3>Illegal Wildlife Trading</h3>
            <p>Despite their current protection under the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/international/cites/" target="_blank">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
                Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)</a> and many national laws, there is still a growing amount of illegal
                trade of <b>Hawksbill</b> shells and products. Because of their recognizable and beautifully patterned
                shells, they are much sought after throughout the tropics to create products like ornaments or jewelry.
                In recent decades, eastern Asia has provided an eager market for tortoiseshell products, which in turn
                further increased the demand in trade for these sea creatures.</p>
        <h3>Pollution</h3>
            <p>Every sea animal in the planet has faced some risk with the problem with pollution, and with growing
                rates of sea waste and plastics polluting the waters and oceans of the world, the <b>Hawksbills</b> are
                no different.  These turtles, along with many other sea animals, can easily mistake plastic from a soda
                bundle or aluminum from the cans themselves as food, causing them to ingest these objects and later die
                because their digestive systems can't process the waste. Not only that, but because of oil and sludge
                spilling out into the waters, many have either been killed by the pollution or had to flee from their
                natural habitats, losing their nesting grounds and being forced to live in waters that aren't theirs,
                and living in a different habitat can be just as deadly.</p>

        <p><b>Hawksbills</b> help maintain the health of coral reefs. When they feed on sponges from a reef's surface,
            they provide better access for reef fish to feed.  Without this access, there would be a food shortage for
            these fish, causing danger to major parts of the ocean's ecosystem.  Without them, there could be major
            loss of entire groups or possibly species of fish or sea animals who need food from these reefs to
            survive.</p>
